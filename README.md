11. nodemon-Auto-restarts the server whenever you make code changes (dev dependency)

12. axios:
             Purpose: Axios is a popular HTTP client library for making HTTP requests from a browser or Node.js. It allows                you to send requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) to a server, and it returns the response in a promise-based              format.
             Use case: You would typically use Axios to fetch or send data to a backend server in React applications. It's                commonly used for API calls to interact with remote servers or external services.

13. react-toastify:
                    Purpose: React Toastify is a simple and customizable notification library for React. It allows you to                        display toast messages, which are small pop-up notifications that appear at the corner of the screen.
                    Use case: It is useful for giving users feedback, such as success messages, error messages, or alerts,                       without interrupting the user’s experience. For example, you could show a success toast after submitting                     a form or an error toast if the user’s action fails.

14.react-router-dom:
                    purpose: React Router is a library used for routing in React applications. It helps you define routes                        (URLs) and associate them with components that should be displayed when a user navigates to that URL.
                    Use case: You’ll use React Router to enable client-side routing in your React app, allowing users to                         navigate between pages without reloading the whole page. This is key to building Single Page                                 Applications (SPAs).
